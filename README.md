## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 2: Meaningful Names

This chapter emphasizes the importance of using clear, descriptive, and intention-revealing names for variables, functions, and classes. Meaningful names improve code readability, reduce confusion, and minimize the need for comments. Proper naming enhances collaboration and long-term maintainability.

### Chapter 3: Functions

This chapter focuses on writing small, well-structured functions that perform a single task. Clean functions improve readability, make code easier to test, and simplify refactoring. Breaking down complex logic into smaller functions leads to more modular and maintainable code.

### Chapter 4: Comments

Robert C. Martin explains that comments should not be used to compensate for poorly written code. Instead, code should be expressive and self-explanatory. Comments are most useful when they provide context or explain complex reasoning that cannot be clearly expressed in code.

### Chapter 6: Objects and Data Structures

This chapter explores the difference between objects and data structures. Objects encapsulate data and expose behavior, while data structures expose data with minimal behavior. Understanding when to use each approach helps developers design clean, flexible, and maintainable systems.

## Conclusion

The selected chapters reinforce the core principles of clean code: clarity, simplicity, and thoughtful design. Applying these principles results in software that is easier to read, maintain, and extend over time.
